        DarkSky has been the platforms source of weather data for several years,
        but unfortunately this has come to an end. DarkSky have been bought by Apple and
        have closed their doors to new API sign-ups. Existing users will have access until
        the end of 2021. You can switch your source of data to Open Weather Map by entering an API for that
        service below. The Open Weather Map API key will always take precedence over the
        DarkSky one. Please see our documentation for more details.

        Open Weather Map have added a new "One Call API 3.0" option to their suite to products. Unfortunately a credit
        card is required to activate this service. Older API keys are not compatible with the new API and therefore
        users will need to choose which API version is required for their key below.
